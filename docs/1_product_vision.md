# Budget Tracker — Product Vision

## 1. Overview

Budget Tracker is a focused, lightweight web application that helps individuals manage daily expenses quickly and clearly.  
It simplifies budgeting into a few essential actions — record, categorize, and review — making financial awareness accessible without complex tools or integrations.

---

## 2. Vision Statement

To make personal budgeting effortless, visual, and fast — a tool that anyone can use daily to stay financially aware in under two minutes.

## 3. Target Users

Budget Tracker is designed for individuals who want a practical, no-frills way to understand and manage their everyday spending.  

**Primary Audience:**  

- **Students and early-career professionals (ages 18–35):** who are learning to manage personal finances independently.  
- Individuals juggling limited budgets (rent, food, transport) and wanting quick visibility into where their money goes.  

**Secondary Audience:**  

- **Freelancers or gig workers:** who track irregular income and expenses manually.  
- **Casual users:** who find traditional budgeting apps overly complex, requiring unnecessary features like investment tracking or bank connections.  

These users share three core behaviors:  

1. They prefer **manual control** over their data instead of automation.  
2. They value **simplicity and speed** more than detailed analytics.  
3. They want to **develop awareness, not dependency** — a quick reflection tool rather than a financial management suite.

## 4. Key Problems

1. **Complex tools:** Existing finance apps require setup, permissions, and financial literacy.  
2. **Low usability:** Manual tracking feels tedious due to slow, multi-step interfaces.  
3. **Lack of clarity:** Data is often shown as numbers instead of clear, visual insights.

## 5. Value Proposition

A distraction-free budgeting app that lets users log expenses in seconds and instantly see where their money goes — simple, clear, and private.
